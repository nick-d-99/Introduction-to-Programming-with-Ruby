=begin

Take the array and turn it into a new array that consists of 
strings containing one word. 
(ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. 
Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well 
as String's split method.

=end

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
  'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

a.map! do |phrase|
  phrase.split(' ')
end
a.flatten!
p a
